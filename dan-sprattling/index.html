                        Building a great website is more than just knowing how to make things look pretty or writing
                        clever code. I listen to your needs, ensuring you get a product you’re happy with. Listen to the
                        great things others have said.

                                Dan's core strength is his ability to adapt and apply critical thinking to a problem. He
                                doesn't just take a project and do it, he will break it down, check it ticks all the
                                boxes (including the ones you forgot about!), and then deliver something beyond your
                                expectations. Work with him without hesitation!

                                to add Dan to your team.

                                site or project. Couldn’t recommend him highly enough!

                                Over the last few months I’ve had the pleasure to work with Dan on the relaunch of our
                                new marketing site. His attention to detail and flexibility to work with in our team’s
                                style made him a delight to work with. Additionally, as an American it was awesome to
                                wake up each day to a fresh package of improvements. To that end we are planning to
                                employ Dan to help us modernize our other two sites as well.
